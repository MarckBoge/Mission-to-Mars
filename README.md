# Mission-to-Mars


## Overview

This project scrape data from various websites to create a new webpage that highlights facts about the planet Mars. I used Splinter and Beautiful Soup Libraries to web scrape data needed to build this web app. I utilizing a Mongo Database to store the gathered data to render a Flask application, coding the functions using Python, and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Finally uploading HTML code to Flask to run the web application. I also used Bootstrap 3 grid systems to create a responsive web app that could be used on all platforms.
